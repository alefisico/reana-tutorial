REANA is a powerful platform designed to streamline and enhance the reproducibility of scientific research, particularly in high-energy physics analysis. It enables researchers to define, execute, and share complex data analysis workflows, ensuring that their work is transparent, verifiable, and easily replicated. By leveraging containerization technology and cloud computing resources, REANA simplifies the management of computational environments, data dependencies, and execution pipelines. This tutorial will guide you through the essential steps of using REANA, from creating your first workflow to deploying it on a remote computing infrastructure. REANA offers a user-friendly approach to reproducible research, empowering you to focus on scientific discovery while automating the underlying infrastructure.
