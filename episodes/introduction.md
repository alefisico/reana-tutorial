## Reproducibility

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, and HEP is no exception.
It ensures that experimental results can be verified independently, bolstering the credibility of scientific findings. 
To achieve reproducibility, researchers must provide detailed descriptions of their methodologies, including the tools, datasets, and parameters used. 
This allows others to replicate the experiments and compare their results. 
Tools like [REANA]() and [Snakemake]() can significantly aid in reproducibility by providing platforms for creating, managing, and sharing reproducible computational workflows. 
These tools help researchers document their experimental steps, track dependencies, and ensure that results can be replicated consistently, fostering trust in scientific discoveries.
