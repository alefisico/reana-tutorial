The CMS collaboration consists of members with varied national origin, ethnic background, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, gender, age, physical ability, and religion. As a community, we are committed to being positive and inclusive in all regards.

We follow the [CERN Code of Conduct](https://hr-dep.web.cern.ch/content/code-of-conduct). Members of CMS must maintain a professional environment in an atmosphere of tolerance and mutual respect and abstain from all forms of harassment, abuse, intimidation, bullying, and mistreatment of any kind. This includes, but is not limited to, intimidation, sexual or crude jokes or comments, offensive images, and unwelcome physical conduct. Members must keep in mind that behavior and language deemed acceptable to one person may not be to another.

We commit to helping our community adhere to this code of conduct and speak up when we see possible violations of it. We strive to treat those outside of CMS as we would members of our own community. In the event that the letter or the spirit of this code has been violated, appropriate action will be taken, up to and including procedures specified in Annex A3.2 of the CMS Constitution.
