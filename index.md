This is a lesson on how to create **workflows** for CMS analysts. In particular, we will create workflows using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#). These workflows then will be used _locally_ in your local/university machine or will run inside the CERN [REANA](https://docs.reana.io/).
